# Cellular Automaton Simulation for Biological Computation (Maman 11)

## Overview
This project is a **cellular automaton simulation** developed as an academic task for the **Biological Computation Course**. It models complex environmental interactions using a particle-based system where each cell interacts with its neighbors based on configurable properties. The project explores emergent behavior and environmental dynamics using cellular automata principles.

## Features
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to demonstrate the capabilities of cellular automata for academic study and research.
- **Complete Configuration Control**: Configure properties for every aspect of the simulation, including pollution dynamics, temperature changes, water transfer, and more.
- **Robust Core Logic**: The heart of the simulation lies in the `core` folder, which meticulously implements the cellular automaton behavior.
- **Graphical User Interface**:
  - Real-time visualization of simulation results
- **Logging**:
  - Info-level messages printed to the console
  - Detailed debug logs saved to `simulation.log`

## Compiling to an Executable

### Compiling for Windows on Windows
1. Ensure PyInstaller is installed:
   ```cmd
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Run the following command to bundle the project into a standalone `.exe` file:
   ```cmd
   C:\Users\Studio\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts\pyinstaller --onefile ^
       --add-data "config/*.py;config" ^
       --add-data "core/*.py;core" ^
       --add-data "display/*.py;display" ^
       --add-data "utils/*.py;utils" ^
       main.py
   ```
3. The executable will be located in the `root` folder folder:
   ```plaintext
   main.exe
   ```

### Compiling for Windows on Linux/Bash
1. Install **PyInstaller** and the necessary cross-compilation tools:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   sudo apt-get install mingw-w64
   ```

2. Use the `--win` option with `PyInstaller` to specify a Windows target:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile \
       --add-data "config/*.py:config" \
       --add-data "core/*.py:core" \
       --add-data "display/*.py:display" \
       --add-data "utils/*.py:utils" \
       --name main.exe \
       main.py
   ```

3. The compiled `.exe` file will be located in the `root` folder:
   ```bash
   ./main.exe
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Executable Closes Immediately**:
   Run the executable from a terminal or Command Prompt to view error messages:
   ```bash
   ./main.exe
   ```

3. **FileNotFoundError**:
   Ensure all `--add-data` paths are correctly specified during compilation.
